GetPot - C++:
--------------

Attention: This version contains a couple of beautiful
---------- new features, that are not documented yet. 
 
           E.g.: -- automated ufo detection
	         -- arbitrary comment delimiters
		 -- arbitrary vector field separators
		 -- tails, i.e. easy access to all tails
		    of options such as '-L' or '-I'.

          Please, refere to the example/ directory
          for usage descriptions.
           
This is the C++ version of the popular GetPot library for 
command line and input file parsing. The documentation
can be downloaded at:

    http://getpot.sourceforge.net

The files in the 'examples' directory should be enough, though, to be 
able to use this library. It is fairly easy to use.

Installation:
-------------

In order to install GetPot, simply copy the file 'GetPot'
somewhere where your c++ compiler can find it.

The 'file emacs-getpot-mode.el' contains some lines of
emacs-lisp code. If you append these lines to your .emacs
file, it will highlight your 'getpot' - input files.

Bug reports, Feature requests:
------------------------------

Please, notify me in case there are any bugs or you think
that there should be more features in the library.

Thanks for using this software.
Enjoy !
