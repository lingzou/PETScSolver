# PETSc for PDEs
*PETSc as a solver non-linear PDEs*

PETSc is a suite of data structures and routines for the scalable (parallel) solution of scientific applications modeled by partial differential equations [See: https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/]

This assumes that you have PETSc correctly installed with your specified gcc and g++ compilers.

Goto CMakeLists.txt and change line 9 and 17 for your gcc and g++ compilers.

Goto FindPETSc.cmake and change line 26/27 for PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH.
